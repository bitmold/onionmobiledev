# OrbotKit

You can find OrbotKit at: [https://github.com/guardianproject/OrbotKit](https://github.com/guardianproject/OrbotKit)

OrbotKit provides a straightforward means to interact with Orbot iOS, so you can integrate support for it easily.

* If you use your own Tor, like [OnionShare](https://github.com/OnionShare/onionshare-ios/), watch for Orbot and bypass it, while it is running.
* If you want to make sure, your users are protected by Tor, like [Save](https://github.com/OpenArchive/Save-app-ios/) or [OnionBrowser](https://github.com/OnionBrowser/OnionBrowser/).
