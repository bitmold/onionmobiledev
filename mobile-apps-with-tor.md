{% endembed %}

[**Orbot: Tor VPN for Android and iOS**](https://orbot.app)

Orbot is a free proxy app that empowers other apps to use the internet more securely. It uses Tor to encrypt your internet traffic and then hides it by bouncing through a series of computers around the world. Orbot is the only app that creates a truly private internet connection on Android and iOS devices. As a Tor VPN, it provides the benefits of the Tor network to mobile users, ensuring privacy and access to blocked websites and services.

[**Tor Browser for Android**](https://torproject.org)

Tor Browser for Android is the official Tor Project browser for Android devices. It's a mobile browser that focuses on privacy and security, allowing users to browse the internet anonymously. The browser blocks trackers, defends against surveillance, and resists fingerprinting. It’s built on the same principles as the desktop version, providing a similar experience of private and secure web browsing on mobile devices.

[**OnionBrowser for iOS**](https://onionbrowser.com)

Like Tor Browser, OnionBrowser is a mobile browser that focuses on privacy and security, allowing users to browse the internet anonymously through built-in Tor support on iOS devices. In this case, it is built upon the Apple WKWebView component, which provides its own methods for enhancing privacy and reducing tracking that OnionBrowser takes advantage of. It isn't a 1-1 perfect clone of Tor Browser, but it does everything possible to be at parity within the constraints of the Apple operating system.

[**OnionShare for Android and iOS**](https://onionshare.org/mobile)

OnionShare is an open-source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files, host websites, and chat using the Tor network. Available for both Android and iOS, this app sets up a secure server directly on your device, allowing you to send and receive files without any third-party involvement. The unique aspect of OnionShare is its use of onion services, ensuring that all data remains encrypted and private during transit.

[**F-Droid for Android**](https://f-droid.org)

F-Droid is an installable catalogue of FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) applications for the Android platform. It functions as an alternative to Google Play Store, focusing on privacy and security. Users can browse, install, and keep track of updates on their device in a similar manner to other app stores, but with the assurance that the apps are open-source and have gone through a rigorous vetting process.

[**Briar**](https://briarproject.org/)

Briar is a unique messaging app designed for activists, journalists, and anyone needing a safe and secure communication platform. Unlike conventional messaging apps, Briar doesn’t rely on a central server - messages are synchronized directly between users' devices. If the internet's down, Briar can sync via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, keeping the information flowing in a crisis. It's perfect for those in situations where security and privacy are paramount.

[**Save by OpenArchive**](https://open-archive.org/save)

Save by OpenArchive is a mobile app designed to help users preserve, protect, and authenticate their digital media. It allows individuals to securely archive their media to trusted, decentralized, and long-term storage providers. The app ensures that valuable digital information, such as videos and photos, are protected from loss, manipulation, or deletion. It's an essential tool for journalists, human rights activists, and archivists who need to safeguard digital evidence and important media assets.

[**Quiet**](https://tryquiet.org)

Whether it's for an organization, a community, or a group chat with friends, Quiet lets you control all your data without running your own servers. While apps like Slack, Discord, and Signal use central servers, Quiet syncs messages directly between a team’s devices, over Tor, with no server required. Quiet stores your community's data only on your community's phones and laptops, so it's always under your control. Quiet gives you a peer-to-peer network that just works, so you can be independent and private without running your own server.

Each of these apps offers unique features and capabilities, particularly focusing on privacy, security, and open-source development, catering to specific needs in the digital privacy and mobile communication space.
