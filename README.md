# ðŸ§… Welcome to Onion Mobile Devs!

Tor, a [free and open-source software](the-history-of-tor.md) for enabling anonymous communication, routes Internet traffic through a worldwide, volunteer overlay network, consisting of thousands of relays, to conceal a user's location and usage from network surveillance or traffic analysis. By integrating [Tor into your mobile app](mobile-concepts/mobile-apps-with-tor.md), you provide your users with the ability to [maintain privacy and evade censorship](the-tor-protocol.md).

By the end of this guide, you will have a thorough understanding of how to [integrate Tor into a mobile application](mobile-concepts/all-the-ways-to-tor.md), aligning with the best practices of open-source development and contributing to the broader goal of [promoting online privacy and freedom](the-history-of-tor.md).
