# Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of digital privacy and security, integrating [Tor](what-is-tor.md) support into mobile applications has become increasingly significant for developers who prioritize user anonymity and data security. This guide aims to provide open-source developers with a comprehensive understanding of how to implement Tor support in mobile apps, ensuring their users can benefit from enhanced privacy features.

Tor, a free and open-source software for enabling anonymous communication, routes Internet traffic through a worldwide, volunteer overlay network, consisting of thousands of relays, to conceal a user's location and usage from network surveillance or traffic analysis. By integrating Tor into your mobile app, you provide your users with the ability to maintain privacy and evade censorship.

By the end of this guide, you will have a thorough understanding of how to integrate Tor into a mobile application, aligning with the best practices of open-source development and contributing to the broader goal of promoting online privacy and freedom.
