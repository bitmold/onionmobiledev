# Where to get help

The best place to chat with us live is on the [Matrix network](https://matrix.org/). We are in the [#guardianproject:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#guardianproject:matrix.org) room on Matrix.org. You can also connect to the broader [Tor community on IRC](https://support.torproject.org/get-in-touch/irc-help/).

Tor Project also offers a [Community Forum discussion site](https://forum.torproject.org/), where we often participate and answer questions.

Guardian Project has a mobile specific [Guardian-Dev Discussion List](https://lists.mayfirst.org/mailman/listinfo/guardian-dev) that you can join and post messages to.

Follow us on Mastodon: [@guardianproject@librem.one](https://social.librem.one/@guardianproject)
